# Plutus On-chain code

- `BuiltinData` -> low-level data type. Cheaper and better performance (this is the level that plutarch works on).
    - The reason for this low-level data types is that they align well with Plutus Core and on-chain code gets transpiled into Plutus Core (lambda calculus bytecode that goes into the blockchain) at **compile time**.
    - Everything in the on-chain code needs to "fit" into `BuiltinData`, if it's more complex, it will eventually need to be reduced to `BuiltinData` 
        - You can wrap it **on-chain** -> expensive
        - You can wrap it **off-chain** -> arbitrary

This ðŸ‘‡ is the code that **validates** or not the tx i.e, if the utxos can or cannot be consumed:

```Haskell
{-# INLINABLE alwaysSucceeds #-}
alwaysSucceeds :: BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ()
alwaysSucceeds _ _ _ = ()

{-# INLINABLE alwaysFails #-}
alwaysFails :: BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> BuiltinData _. ()
alwaysFails _ _ _ = error ()
```

- These are the **conditions** the transaction **must meet** in order for the utxos to be **consumed**. 


- `{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}` is a Haskell compiler extension, it allows you to do one thing: 
    - Plutus only uses certain parts of the libraries that it is importing. 
    - In the case of `TemplateHaskell`, Plutus uses it to **generate code at compile time**. 

    ```Haskell
    validator :: Validator
    validator = mkValidatorScript $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| goodRedeemer ||])
    ```
-                                           In order for this ðŸ‘† to be INLINABLE, you need to include the INLINABLE pragma `{-# INLINABLE goodRedeemer #-}`

## Defining the validator
```Haskell
{-# INLINABLE goodRedeemer #-}
goodRedeemer :: BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ()
goodRedeemer _ redeemer _ 
  | redeemer == Builtins.mkI 42         = ()
  | otherwise              = traceError "Wrong Redeemer!"

```
- This ðŸ‘† `goodRedeemer` will **succeed** if the value `42` is provided and **fail** `otherwise`. 
- The `goodRedeemer` function cares **only** about the `redeemer`.

- Why use template Haskell and INLINABLE pragmas? 
  - To increase modularity and maintanability, i.e.,
  ```
   validator :: Validator
  validator = mkValidatorScript $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| goodRedeemer :: BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ()
                                                        goodRedeemer _ redeemer _ 
                                                          | redeemer == Builtins.mkI 42         = ()
                                                          | otherwise              = traceError "Wrong Redeemer!" ||])
  ```
  - ðŸ‘† This is going to be a pain to maintain.
    ```Haskell
    {-# INLINABLE goodRedeemer #-}
    goodRedeemer :: BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> BuiltinData -> ()
    goodRedeemer _ redeemer _ 
      | redeemer == Builtins.mkI 42         = ()
      | otherwise              = traceError "Wrong Redeemer!"

    validator :: Validator
    validator = mkValidatorScript $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| goodRedeemer ||])
  ```
  - Whereas this ðŸ‘†, will allow us to update `goodRedeemer` without modifying the `validator`. 

- The `Builtins.mkI` is a necessary wrapper function that turns the `Int` type into a `BuiltinData` type. The `I` is the constructor inside `BuiltinData` for **integer** values, not **floats**.
